There is a correlation between **security services** and **churn**. The statistics show that most churn customers did not use security/protection services (`OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup` and `DeviceProtection`). It needs to be investigated why they did not use the security services; is it due their lack of awareness of security services, or lack of trust etc. Afterwards, we can launch campaign that increase awareness/trust on security services that might lead to decrease on the churn rate.\n2. Majority of churn customers did not use `TechSupport`, which also might correlate #1 insight. It might probable that customers are only aware with security services or able to activate the security services once they talk to TechSupport. The onboarding process of security services might need to be relooked whether it is easy enough for the user to subscribe the security services without talking to TechSupport. *Alternatively*, we should look the problem in **wider** perspectives that some customers might be frustrated with the **general services**, not only security services. Instead of talking to TechSupport, they decided to churn instead. TechSupport might need to be made more accessible to the customers in order to reduce the churn rate.\n3. Majority of churn customers used `Month-to-month` contract, which make them easier to terminate the contract at any time. We need to beware of the quality of our services since `One year` and `Two year` might also want to terminate the services once the contract ends and we need to retent them in our platform.
